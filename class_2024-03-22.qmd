## Setup

```{r}
emp = DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "class_2024-03-22_sqlite/employees.sqlite")
flt = DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "class_2024-03-22_sqlite/flights.sqlite")
```

## Exercise 1

SELECT dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY dept ORDER BY avg_salary;
```


## Exercise 2

```{sql}
#| connection: emp
SELECT dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY dept
```

```{sql}
#| connection: emp
SELECT name, salary, dept, salary - avg_salary AS abv_avg  FROM employees LEFT JOIN (SELECT dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY dept) USING (dept) ORDER BY dept, abv_avg;
```


## Exercise 3

### Wrong answer

```{sql}
#| connection: flt
SELECT SUM(seats) FROM flights NATURAL LEFT JOIN planes;
